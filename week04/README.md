## 1. Batch Processing
- Run the model periodically (hourly, daily, monthly)
- Usually, a ***scoring job*** performs the following steps:
    - Pull data from database
    - Run model on the data
    - Write prediction results to another database
    - Another script pulls from results database and shows dashboards 📊 📈 💰 
- Example use cases:
    - Marketing data:
        >▶️ predict users about to churn on a daily basis<br>
        >▶️ send attractive offers to avoid churn
